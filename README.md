    * I have no idea:
        1. what kind of database I should use.
            * DynamoDB is a leading contender mostly for learning purposes
            * MySQL is relational and is familiar
        2. where to start this kind of project. I know what website I want to yank data from but beyond that, this will be a "learn as you go" scenario.
